Courses:
English(U), Math(U), Law(M), Chemistry(U), Physics(U), Co-op(D), Computer Science (U)

Desired Average:
90%+ A 90+ average would allow me to be accepted into a good university. uOttawa serves as a backup in which I will need an 80+ average and a 90+ average would secure it and uOttawa also allows me to do 3 years of honors then go straight to law school instead of waiting another year.

Other plans:
I will stay on track to do 10 volunteer hours per year to finish them. I also plan to secure a summer job via my Co-op placement in a law firm.

I will use the time after graduation to take a breather for a week or two and perfect my resume for a part-time job alongside university. In the summer before university I will stay up nights with my father and trade stocks with him so I can save up money for my university tuition. I will also continue investing in university but not as much.
